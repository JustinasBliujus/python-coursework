## Task Summary

### Goal

- Train CNNs to classify:
  - Images using **2D convolutions**
  - Keystroke time series using **1D convolutions**
- Perform experiments by modifying network architecture and hyperparameters
- Analyze performance via accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices

### Files listed and remarks

- `img.py` training and evaluating of a model to distinguish between Muffin vs Chihuahua → [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification)`.
- A local file containing images should be created for `img.py` to work.
- `text.py` training and evaluating of a model for the data in `SPD.csv`
- `data_processing.py` functions for loading and processing data
- `error_analysis` functions for computing error
- `graphs.py` contains plotting functions
- `predict_and_evaluate.py` contains functions for prediction and evaluation

- For this task we were required to find an existing solution and adjust it to our needs.
- This solutions is based on → [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc) by Nicholas Renotte
