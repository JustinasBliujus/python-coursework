# ðŸŽ“ AI University Assignments

This repository contains  university assignments focused on artificial intelligence and neural networks, completed during the course in python.

## Tasks Overview

### `ai_1/` â€“ Artificial Neuron

Implements a basic artificial neuron for binary classification of 2D data using threshold and sigmoid activation functions. Includes:
- Manual weight search (no learning),
- Data visualization,
- Classification boundary plotting.

See [ai_1/README](./ai_1) for details.

### `ai_2/` â€“ Neuron Training with Gradient Descent

Trains a single sigmoid neuron using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.
- Two training methods: **Batch Gradient Descent** and **Stochastic Gradient Descent**,
- Tracks accuracy, loss, and performance across epochs,
- Visualizes training and validation results.

See [ai_2/README](./ai_2) for details.

### `ai_3/` â€“ CNNs for Images & Time Series

Uses **2D CNNs** for image classification and **1D CNNs** for time series data (keystroke dynamics).
- Supports different architectures and hyperparameters,
- Compares dropout, activation functions, optimizers, etc.
- Evaluates final performance and confusion matrices.

See [ai_3/README](./ai_3) for details.
